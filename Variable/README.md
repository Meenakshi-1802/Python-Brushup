# ğŸ“˜ Variable Notes  

## ğŸ”¹ What are Variables?  
Variables are **containers that store data** in memory. They have a **name** and a **value**, and the value can change during program execution.

## ğŸ”¹ Rules for Naming Variables  
- Must start with a **letter** or **underscore**.  
- Can contain **letters, digits, and underscores** only.  
- **Case-sensitive** â†’ (`age` â‰  `Age`).  
- Cannot use **reserved keywords** (`if`, `class`, `for`, etc.).
