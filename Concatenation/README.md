# String Concatenation in Python

## ðŸ”¹ Definition
- **String concatenation** means joining strings together using the `+` operator.  
- When two strings are added, they are placed next to each other as one continuous string.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Rules
1. Strings can be concatenated **only with other strings**.  
2. Concatenation of **different data types** (e.g., string + int/float) is **not allowed** directly.  
3. To concatenate different data types, they must first be converted to a string using **`str()`**.

## ðŸ”¹ Concatenation of Different Data Types
- When you need to combine text with numbers or other values, convert the non-string values into strings.  
- This is typically done using the `str()` function before concatenation.

## âœ… Example Use Case
Concatenating multiple employee details into a single string (joining numbers, floats, and strings together using `str()` conversion).
