# üìò Chapter 5: Python Installation and Versions

This chapter will guide you through the complete setup of Python on your system. It includes downloading and installing Python, understanding the two main modes (Interactive and Script), running Python from the command line, using IDLE, performing basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and installing PyCharm IDE.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Python Installation on Windows

### Step 1: Download Python

- Visit the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads
- Click on the latest version available for Windows.
- Download the appropriate installer, such as `python-3.13.5-amd64.exe`.

### Step 2: Install Python

- Move the downloaded file to the `C:\` drive.
- Right-click the installer ‚Üí Select **Run as Administrator** ‚Üí Click **Yes**.
- Make sure to check the box that says **Add Python to PATH**.
- Click **Install Now**.
- Once the installation is complete, click **Close**.

### Step 3: Verify Python Installation

- Open the **Command Prompt**.
- Type the command to check if Python is installed successfully.
- The version number will be displayed if everything is correct.

## üß† 2. What is IDLE?

- **IDLE** stands for **Integrated Development and Learning Environment**.
- It is a simple editor that comes with Python installation.
- IDLE supports two ways to work:
  - **Interactive Mode** ‚Äì for testing code quickly
  - **Script Mode** ‚Äì for writing and saving full programs

---

## üí° 3. Interactive Mode

- In this mode, you type Python commands directly and get the result immediately.
- Used mainly for quick testing or learning.
- You can open it through **Command Prompt** or by launching **IDLE**.

---

## üìù 4. Script Mode

- In Script Mode, you write full Python programs and save them with the `.py` extension.
- These scripts can be saved and run multiple times.
- This mode is preferred for writing business logic or larger programs.
- You can use IDLE or any text editor like Notepad, Notepad++, or an IDE.

---

## ‚ûï‚ûñ‚úñÔ∏è‚ûó 5. Basic Python Operations

Python supports all basic arithmetic operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

These operations are the foundation of any logic building in Python and are essential for data processing.

---

## üì¶ 6. What is pip?

- **pip** stands for **Pip Installs Packages**.
- It is Python‚Äôs built-in package manager.
- It is used to install and manage additional libraries and tools.
- You can install libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc., using pip.
- pip is installed automatically when you install Python from python.org.

---

## üíª 7. Running Python Scripts via Command Line

- Python files with `.py` extension can be executed directly from the Command Prompt.
- This allows you to test scripts without opening any editor or IDE.
- You must navigate to the folder where your script is saved and then run it.

---

## üîß 8. Installing PyCharm IDE

### Step 1: Download PyCharm

- Go to: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download
- Download the **Community Edition** (free version).

### Step 2: Install PyCharm

- Move the setup file to the `C:\` drive.
- Right-click ‚Üí Select **Run as Administrator** ‚Üí Click **Yes**.
- Follow the installation wizard:
  - Click **Next**.
  - Check all boxes (like creating a shortcut, associating `.py` files, etc.).
  - Choose a folder for installation (e.g., JetBrains).
  - Click **Install**.

### Step 3: Launch PyCharm

- After installation, launch PyCharm from the desktop shortcut.
- Accept terms and conditions.
- Choose default settings or customize as per your preference.

## üß™ 9. Creating Your First Project in PyCharm

- Click on **New Project**.
- Set the location to something like `D:\mypython`.
- Select **New Environment using virtualenv**.
- Click **Create**.

---

## üé® 10. Customizing PyCharm for Better Use

- **Theme**: Go to `File ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Appearance` ‚Üí Choose a theme (e.g., Win10 Lite).
- **Font Size**: `File ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Editor ‚Üí Font` ‚Üí Set a larger font (e.g., 20).
- **Color Scheme**: `Editor ‚Üí Color Scheme ‚Üí Classic Light`.

---

## üîç 11. Enabling IntelliSense in PyCharm

- Go to `File ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Plugins`.
- Search for and install **PyLint**.
- Restart PyCharm to activate auto-suggestions and error checking.

---

## üìù 12. Writing Your First Python File in PyCharm

- Right-click on your project folder ‚Üí Select `New ‚Üí Python File`.
- Give it a name (e.g., `test.py`).
- Start writing your Python program inside the file.
- Right-click the file ‚Üí Select `Run`.
