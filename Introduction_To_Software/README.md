# üìò Chapter 2: Introduction to Software

**Software** is a collection of programs such as C, C++, Java, Python, HTML, and others.

Software is mainly divided into two categories:

## üß© Software Categories

## Software
## ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ System Software
## ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Application Software


---

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Software
- Interacts directly with **hardware components**
- Example: **Operating Systems**

> ‚ùì **Q. Can we run any program without an OS?**  
> ‚úÖ **Ans:** No.  
> Except BIOS, all programs require an Operating System to run.

### üß† BIOS (Basic Input and Output System)
- A **hardware-level program** embedded on a chip
- Responsible for **booting** the OS
- **Booting**: The process of loading the Operating System from **Hard Disk to RAM**

## üñ•Ô∏è What is an Operating System?

1. A **platform** to run all application software  
2. Acts as an **interface** between hardware and application software  
3. Has built-in **libraries** for communication between applications and hardware  
4. Every program must **link** with the OS library before execution

## üß© Application Software

### ‚û§ Front-End Software  
- Interacts with **end users**  
- Collects data from users and sends to the back-end  
- Examples: Languages, ERPs, UI apps

### ‚û§ Back-End Software  
- Handles **server-side logic** and **database operations**  
- Examples: Databases, Files, HDFS (Big Data Storage)

> üìå Python is a **Back-End Programming / Scripting Language** used to develop server-side applications.

## üß† Software Languages Classification

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Low-Level Language
- **System-understandable** language (Binary: `11001010`)  
- Executed directly by **processors** like 8085, 8086  
- Also called **Machine Language**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ High-Level Language
- **Human-understandable** (like English)  
- Easier to learn and write  
- Examples: `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `Python`, `HTML`, `.NET`, `Scala`

> ‚ùì **Q. Which is the first developed high-level language?**  
> ‚úÖ **C Language** developed by **Dennis Ritchie** in **1972**

## üîÑ Language Conversion

High-Level Language ‚ûù Binary Code  
‚û°Ô∏è Requires an **Interpreter** or **Compiler**

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Compiler** | Converts entire code at once |
| **Interpreter** | Executes code line-by-line |

---

## üîç Difference Between Compiler and Interpreter

| S.No | Interpreter | Compiler |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Executes line-by-line | Executes whole program |
| 2 | Gives result one line at a time | Gives output at once |
| 3 | Stops at first error | Checks all errors |
| 4 | No `.exe` file generated | Generates `.exe` if no error |
| 5 | Executes **source code** only | Executes **compiled file** |
| 6 | Scripting languages | Programming languages |
| 7 | Examples: Python, Shell, HTML, JS | Examples: C, C++, .NET C# |
| 8 | No `.exe` concept | Uses `.exe` |
| 9 | Open-source, modifiable | Not open-source (compiled) |

---

## ‚òï About Java

Java uses **both Compiler and Interpreter**:

## Source Code ‚Üí Byte Code ‚Üí Binary Code ‚Üí Processor ‚Üí Output

- **Java Compiler**: Converts source code to byte code  
- **Java Interpreter**: Converts byte code to binary for execution
