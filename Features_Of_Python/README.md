# üêç Chapter 3: Features of Python

Python is a powerful, beginner-friendly, and versatile programming language. Below are the top features that make Python one of the most widely used languages across industries.

## ‚úÖ 15 Key Features of Python

1. **Platform Independent**  
   - Python scripts can run on any operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS).
   - There is no `.exe` file in Python; it contains only pure Python code.
   - The Python interpreter is OS-dependent, but Python scripts are OS-independent.
   - ‚úÖ Write Once, Run Anywhere
     

2. **Portable**  
   - Python applications are portable ‚Äî the same code runs on different OSes without modification.
   - Unlike C, Python code does not rely on OS-specific syntax.
     

3. **Dynamically Typed**  
   - No need to declare variable types explicitly.
   - Python decides the type at runtime.  
   ```python
   x = 10       # Integer  
   x = "Hello"  # Now it's a string
    

4. **Python Collections**

Used to store and manage large volumes of data.

Supports: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and the collections module.

Improves performance in server-side applications.


5. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

Supports encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance (including multiple inheritance), and polymorphism.

Python supports both procedure-oriented and object-oriented programming.


6. **Exception Handling**

Manages errors gracefully without crashing the program.

try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Error:", e)

    
7. **I/O Streams and File Handling**

Python supports reading/writing files easily.

with open('sample.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()

    
8. **Multi-Threading**

Supports concurrent execution using threads.

Useful for parallel, real-time, and background tasks.

import threading  
def task():  
    print("Running in thread")  
thread = threading.Thread(target=task)  
thread.start()


9. **Network Programming**

Supports socket programming and RESTful APIs.

Libraries: socket, requests, asyncio

import socket  
s = socket.socket()  
s.connect(("example.com", 80))


10. **Database Access**

Supports integration with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, etc.

Libraries: sqlite3, mysql.connector, psycopg2

import sqlite3  
conn = sqlite3.connect('data.db')  
cursor = conn.cursor()


11. **Rich Standard Library**

Comes with built-in modules for math, regex, file I/O, web services, threading, testing, GUI, and more.

12. **Embeddable**

Python can be embedded into other languages like C/C++.

Also allows calling C/C++ code from Python scripts.

13. **GUI Programming**

Supports graphical user interface development using:

Tkinter

PyQt

wxPython

Kivy

import tkinter as tk  
window = tk.Tk()  
window.title("My App")  
window.mainloop()


14. **Modular Programming**

Allows splitting large programs into reusable modules and packages.

Promotes clean code and better maintenance.

# mymodule.py  
def greet():  
    print("Hello!")  

# main.py  
import mymodule  
mymodule.greet()


15. **Free and Open Source**

Python is freely available and open-source under FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software).
