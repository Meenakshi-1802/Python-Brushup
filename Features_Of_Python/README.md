## 🔹 1. Platform Independent

- Python scripts can run on **any operating system** (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- There is **no `.exe` file** in Python; it contains only pure Python code.
- **Python Interpreter** is OS-dependent, but the **Python script** is **OS-independent**.
- When a Python script runs, the interpreter links the script to the current OS library during execution.
- ✅ **Write Once, Run Anywhere**

---

## 🔹 2. Portable

- Python applications are **portable** — they can be moved from one OS to another **without changes**.
- The same Python code runs on all major OSes.
- 🔁 Unlike C, which has OS-dependent code, Python maintains one scripting standard across platforms.

## 🔹 3. Dynamically Typed

- No need to declare data types during variable assignment.
- The **data type is decided at runtime**.
```python

🔹 4. Python Collections
Used to store and manage large volumes of data at the server side.

Enhances application performance.

Supports lists, sets, tuples, dictionaries, and advanced collections (collections module).
 🔹 5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Python supports both procedure-oriented and object-oriented programming.

Supports:

Encapsulation

Abstraction

Inheritance (including multiple inheritance)

Polymorphism

## 🔹 6. Exception Handling
Python provides robust exception handling to manage runtime errors gracefully using:

python
Copy
Edit
try:
    # risky code
except Exception as e:
    # handle error
## 🔹 7. I/O Streams and File Handling
Python supports reading/writing files using:

python
Copy
Edit
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()
## 🔹 8. Multi-Threading
Python supports multi-threading to execute multiple threads (lightweight processes) simultaneously.

Useful in real-time, parallel, and concurrent programming.

## 🔹 9. Network Programming
Python supports socket programming for network communication.

Libraries: socket, asyncio, requests, etc.

## 🔹 10. Database Access
Python provides custom and ODBC interfaces to:

MySQL

Oracle

PostgreSQL

MS SQL Server

SQLite

Libraries: sqlite3, mysql-connector-python, psycopg2

## 🔹 11. Rich Standard Library
Includes modules for:

Math

File I/O

Web Services

Regex

Unit Testing

GUI

Threading

Email, Image Processing, and more

## 🔹 12. Embeddable
Python code can be:

Embedded inside C/C++ code

Called from other languages for scripting capabilities

Useful in custom software integration.

## 🔹 13. GUI Programming
Create Graphical User Interfaces using:

Tkinter

PyQt

wxPython

Kivy

## 🔹 14. Modular Programming
Python allows you to divide code into reusable modules and packages.

Helps in better organization and reuse of code.

## 🔹 15. Free and Open Source
Python is available free of cost.

Open source under the FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software) model.
