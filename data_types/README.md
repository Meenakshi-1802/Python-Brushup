# ðŸ“˜ Python Data Types  

##  What are Data Types?  
A **data type** defines the kind of value a variable can store and the operations that can be performed on it.  
In Python, every value has a data type.  

Example:  
x = 10        # int
y = 3.14      # float
z = "Hello"   # str

## Primitive vs Non-Primitive Data Types
# 1. Primitive Data Types

The most basic or fundamental data types.

Store simple values.

Directly supported by the language.

Examples in Python:

int â†’ Integer numbers

float â†’ Decimal numbers

complex â†’ Complex numbers (a+bj)

bool â†’ Boolean values (True/False)

str â†’ Strings (text data)

# 2. Non-Primitive (or Derived / Advanced) Data Types

Built using primitive data types.

Used to store collections of data or key-value pairs.

Can be mutable (changeable) or immutable.

Examples in Python:

Sequence Types: list, tuple, range

Set Types: set, frozenset

Mapping Type: dict

Binary Types: bytes, bytearray
