# ðŸ§  Python Memory Management

## 1. Overview
Python manages memory automatically with the help of its **memory manager** and **garbage collector**.  
It organizes memory into different sections based on usage.

---

## 2. Python memory is divided into different areas:
- **Stack Memory** â†’ Stores reference variables and function call data.
- **Heap Memory** â†’ Stores actual objects.
- **Global Memory** â†’ Stores global variables.
- **Static Memory** â†’ Stores static variables.
- **Text Memory** â†’ Stores program instructions.

## 3. Stack and Heap Memory for Python Variables

When you create a variable in Python:
1. **Stack memory** stores the **reference variable**.
2. **Heap memory** stores the **actual object**.
3. The reference variable in stack points to the object's location in heap.

## 2. Higher Order Memory Space
- Stores all **command-line arguments**.
- Stores **operating system environment variables**.

---

## 4. Stack Memory Space
- Stores **local variables**.
- Memory allocation follows **LIFO (Last In, First Out)**.
- Grows automatically as long as sharable memory is available.
- If the stack is full, it raises a **stack overflow exception**.
- Python is **dynamically typed** â€” variable declaration is not necessary, and variable types are determined at runtime.
- Every time a value is assigned, a **new memory location** is created.
- In Python, there is no concept of simple variables; everything is a **reference variable**.
- Reference variables are stored in **stack memory** and refer to **objects** stored in **heap memory**.
- Supports **memory pooling** (memory reusability).

---

## 5. Shared Memory Space
- Can be shared by both **stack** and **heap**.

---

## 6. Heap Memory Space
- Used for **dynamic memory management**.
- Memory allocation and deallocation happen **at runtime**.
- Grows automatically as long as sharable memory is available.
- Memory allocation is **random**.
- Contains the **data** and its **address**, which is stored in reference variables inside the stack.

---

## 7. Global Memory Space
- Stores **global variables**.
- Size depends on the number of global variables declared in the Python application.

---

## 8. Static Memory Space
- Stores **static variables**.
- Size is fixed according to the number of static variables declared in the Python application.

---

## 9. Text Memory Space
- Contains all **Python program instructions**.
- Stores **Python libraries**.

---

## 10. Key Points
- **Stack** contains all reference variables.
- **Heap** contains objects that reference variables point to.
- Memory management in Python is handled **automatically**.
- Python is **100% object-oriented** â€” all values are objects.

# ðŸ’¾ RAM vs Hard Disk  

Memory management is about how a computer **stores, organizes, and uses data** efficiently.  
The two main types of storage involved are **RAM (Random Access Memory)** and **Hard Disk**.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ RAM (Random Access Memory)  
- **Type:** Volatile memory (data is lost when power is off).  
- **Speed:** Very fast compared to hard disk.  
- **Usage:** Stores data and instructions that the CPU needs *right now*.  
- **Capacity:** Smaller (GBs).  

### âœ… Characteristics  
- Temporary storage for running programs.  
- Allows quick read/write operations.  
- Directly accessed by CPU.  

**Example:**  
When you open a program (e.g., MS Word), it is loaded from the Hard Disk into RAM so it runs faster.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Hard Disk (HDD/SSD)  
- **Type:** Non-volatile memory (data stays even when power is off).  
- **Speed:** Slower than RAM, but much larger.  
- **Usage:** Stores permanent files, software, operating system, documents, etc.  
- **Capacity:** Larger (GBs to TBs).  

### âœ… Characteristics  
- Long-term storage of data.  
- Data must be loaded from Hard Disk into RAM before execution.  
- Slower access compared to RAM, but cheaper and bigger.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ How They Work Together (Memory Management)  
1. **Program Execution**  
   - When you run a program, the **OS loads it from Hard Disk â†’ into RAM**.  
   - CPU executes instructions from RAM (faster access).  

2. **Virtual Memory**  
   - If RAM is full, OS uses part of the Hard Disk as **swap space (virtual RAM)**.  
   - This prevents system crashes but is slower.  

3. **Cache Management**  
   - CPU has its own cache (even faster than RAM).  
   - Frequently used data is moved closer to CPU for speed.

## ðŸ”¹ Comparison Table  

| Feature          | RAM (Random Access Memory) | Hard Disk (HDD/SSD) |
|------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Type             | Volatile                   | Non-volatile |
| Speed            | Very fast (nanoseconds)    | Slower (milliseconds) |
| Size             | Smaller (GBs)              | Larger (GBsâ€“TBs) |
| Cost             | More expensive per GB      | Cheaper per GB |
| Usage            | Temporary program execution | Permanent data storage |
| Data Retention   | Lost after power off       | Retained after power off |

## ðŸ“Œ Summary  
- **RAM** â†’ Fast, temporary, used for running programs.  
- **Hard Disk** â†’ Slow, permanent, used for long-term storage.  
- **Memory Management** ensures smooth transfer between Hard Disk â†’ RAM â†’ CPU.
