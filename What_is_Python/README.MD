## üîç Key Features of Python

1. **Scripting Language**  
   Python is interpreter-based, so it‚Äôs considered a scripting language.  
   - Interpreter executes source code directly (no `.exe` file created)  
   - Open-source and modifiable

2. **High-Level Language**  
   Python is human-readable, similar to English. Easy for beginners to learn.

3. **Interpreter-Based Language**  
   Python code is not compiled, it‚Äôs interpreted line by line during execution.

4. **Interactive Language**  
   Python supports interaction via command-line like Linux or Python shell.

5. **Procedure-Oriented Language**  
   Allows writing programs using functions and procedures.

6. **Functional-Oriented Language**  
   Supports functions as first-class citizens (e.g., lambdas, map, filter).

7. **Object-Oriented Language**  
   Python supports OOP concepts like:  
   - Encapsulation  
   - Abstraction  
   - Inheritance  
   - Polymorphism

8. **Modular Programming**  
   Large programs can be divided into smaller reusable modules.

9. **General-Purpose Language**  
   Can be used to develop a wide variety of applications.
