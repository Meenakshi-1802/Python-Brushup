# Python Identifiers

## 1. Introduction
An **identifier** is the name given to a program element in Python.  
It is **user-defined** and is used to identify variables, functions, classes, objects, and procedures.

## 2. Rules for Naming Identifiers

1. **Must start with**:
   - A letter (A–Z or a–z), or
   - An underscore `_`

2. **Can be followed by**:
   - Letters (A–Z, a–z)
   - Digits (0–9)
   - Underscores `_`
   - Zero or more characters after the first one.

3. **Case-sensitive**:
   - Identifiers treat uppercase and lowercase letters as different.

4. **Cannot use reserved keywords**:
   - Python keywords like `if`, `for`, `class`, `def`, etc. cannot be used as identifiers.

## 3. Best Practices for Naming Identifiers
- Use meaningful and descriptive names.
- **Snake case**: Words are written in lowercase and separated by underscores (`_`).  
  Example style: `my_variable_name`
- **Pascal case**: Each word starts with an uppercase letter and no underscores.  
  Example style: `MyVariableName`
- Avoid using single-character names except for loop counters.
