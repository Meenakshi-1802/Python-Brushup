# **Chapter 7 – Multiple Statements in One Line**

### 1. What It Means
- In Python, you can write **more than one statement** in a single line by separating them with a **semicolon (`;`)**.
- Each statement is executed **from left to right**.

---

### 2. Syntax 
statement1; statement2; statement3
a = 7; print(a)

### 3. Points to Remember
Semicolon separates the statements.
Works well for short, quick commands.
Avoid using it for long code — it makes the program hard to read.
Python does not require a semicolon at the end of a line like C, C++, or Java — only use it to separate multiple statements in the same line.
