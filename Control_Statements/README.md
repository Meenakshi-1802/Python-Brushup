# Control Statements in Python 🚀

Control statements are used to **make decisions** in a program.  
They help the program **choose different paths** based on conditions.

---

## 1️⃣ Simple `if`
- The `if` statement checks a condition.  
- If the condition is **True**, a block of code is executed.  
- If the condition is **False**, nothing happens.  

---

## 2️⃣ `if-else`
- The `if-else` statement provides **two alternative paths**.  
- If the condition is **True** → one block is executed.  
- If the condition is **False** → the other block is executed.  

---

## 3️⃣ Nested `if`
- A **nested if** means an `if` inside another `if`.  
- Used when one decision depends on the result of another condition.  
- Useful for checking **multiple levels of conditions**.  

---

## 4️⃣ If-elif-else (Ladder if / If-elif ladder)
- Used when we need to check **multiple conditions one by one**.  
- Conditions are checked **from top to bottom**.  
- The first condition that is **True** is executed, and the rest are skipped.  
- If none are True, the **else block** (if present) runs.

## 🔑 Difference: Nested If vs Ladder If

| Feature | Nested If | Ladder If (if-elif-else) |
|---------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Structure | One `if` inside another | Multiple conditions in sequence |
| Readability | More complex (due to indentation) | Easier to read and follow |
| Use Case | When conditions are **dependent** on each other | When checking **separate multiple conditions** |
| Testing Style | Mostly used for **positive tests** (checking only when previous condition is True) | Mostly used for **negative tests** (checking conditions step by step until one is False or True) |

---

## ✅ Summary
- **if** → single condition  
- **if-else** → two choices  
- **nested if** → decision inside another decision  
- **if-elif-else ladder** → many conditions checked step by step

💡 These control statements make programs **dynamic and decision-making**!
