### Capitalization Rule for Keywords
- Out of 33 keywords, only **True**, **False**, and **None** are capitalized.
- All other keywords are in lowercase.

## 2. Naming Conventions in Python

1. **Class Names** â†’ Use **PascalCase** (Uppercase initials for each word).  
2. **All Other Identifiers** â†’ Use **lowercase** or `snake_case`.  
3. **Private Identifier** â†’ Start with a single underscore `_` (e.g., `_identifier`).  
4. **Strongly Private Identifier** â†’ Start with two underscores `__` (e.g., `__identifier`).  
5. **Special Identifiers by Python** â†’ Start and end with double underscores (e.g., `__specialname__`).
